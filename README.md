# Kanban board
This project is started as practical way to learn React JS. From simplies TODO table I want to create big project that can be used on real projects(I think so =) ).

## Features
- [x] Initial project setup.
- [x] TODO - In progress - Done table view.
- [] Logic of CRUD operations without DB support.
- [] DB and server side integration.

## Feature ideas
- [] Sign up and log in support, user page.
- [] Add projects as separate board.
- [] Add tasks types with different color markers.
- [] Add backlog, testing and blocked statuses.
- [] Add teams as users iteractions.
